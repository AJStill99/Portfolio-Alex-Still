## Exploratory Testing Report

## Overview
Exploratory testing was conducted alongside automated testing to identify edge cases, behavioural inconsistencies, and user experience issues that are inefficient or impractical to validate through automation alone.

This approach supports the automated test suite by providing qualitative insights into application behaviour, design decisions, and user flows that may not be easily detected through scripted tests.

## Approach
The exploratory testing session was time-boxed to one hour and executed using the Chrome browser.

Testing was performed without predefined test cases, focusing instead on:
- General UI and UX behaviour
- User navigation flows
- Error handling and feedback
- Responsiveness to unexpected or rapid user interactions

This session prioritised observation, critical thinking, and real user behaviour to complement the coverage provided by automated tests.
