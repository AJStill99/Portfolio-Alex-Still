Hello, this is my portfolio project using Playwright to automate QA testing for a variety of sites.

This project demonstrates the capabilities of Playwright in performing end-to-end testing, including:
- Cross-browser testing
- Responsive design testing
- Performance testing

In preparation, I have created some test data; including users, checkout data, errors, and products. This is in an aid to make the code more manageable to simulate real tests a little better. 

YML File - Only runs on main currently, but opens a brand new machine, installs what needs to be installed and runs whenever I push to main or on a pull request.

I will use one of my own websites I created for this project, using a simple HTML/CSS/JS stack, which will eventually be hosted somewhere (maybe GitHub pages)

Tests used here: 
- Auth
- Cart
- Checkout + Checkout-validation (failing case)
- Navigation
- Products
- Smoke
